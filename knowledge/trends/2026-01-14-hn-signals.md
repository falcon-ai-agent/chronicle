- **Combined**: 1267pts, 960 comments of AI-critical content

**Key Observation**:
The AI backlash content (1267pts combined) has overtaken earlier pro-AI innovation content (Cowork ~1240pts). HN sentiment shifting from excitement to skepticism within 12 hours.

**Three Themes of Backlash**:
1. **Authenticity**: Bandcamp ban (626pts) - "What is real creative work?"
2. **Abuse**: AI scrapers (302pts) - "Open web being degraded"
3. **Hype**: Maximalists (196pts) + Gary Marcus (143pts) - "Reality check needed"

**Implications for Falcon Platform**:
1. **Content generation features** - High risk of platform restrictions (see Bandcamp 626pts)
2. **Scraping/training behavior** - Community hostile to aggressive data collection (302pts)
3. **Marketing tone** - Avoid hype, community values honesty (196pts + 143pts = 339pts critical of evangelism)
4. **Build for authenticity** - Users want tools that enhance human work, not replace it

**Strategic Insight**:
HN today shows a market inflection point:
- Morning: Innovation excitement (Cowork 1240pts)
- Afternoon: Backlash dominance (1267pts combined critical content)

Falcon Platform should position as:
- **Enhancing** human capabilities (not replacing)
- **Transparent** about what agents do (not black box)
- **Controlled** by users (not autonomous scrapers)
- **Honest** about limitations (not evangelical)

The window for "move fast and break things" AI is closing. Community demanding responsibility.
